                    <p>Suspension Type Magnets are most useful for products carried by the Belt Conveyors. Use of Suspension Type Magnets is recommended for products with low contamination. However if the frequency of the impurities is too high, these will make a layer shunting magnetic field. The equipment will require frequent cleaning. For such applications Over Band type Magnetic Separator is recommended. The main applications are for the processing of Bulk products such as Sugar, Coal, Minerals, Cereals, Coffee, Glass, Culets etc.for installation:JMPL magnets can be installed either at the end of the belt above the head drum , or across the conveyor belt. In both cases, to avoid disturbances to the magnetic field, a magnetic parts must be planced below the surface of the magnet. The installation shown on figure 1 is preferable for high speeds. Separation is more efficient due to the trajectory of the fact that it is then "fluidised".
