                    <h2>GRANITE SURFACE PLATES</h2>
                    <p>Granite surface plates are manufactured using natural black granite stone, quarried from earth in its natural form. These plates are precision lapped to high standards of flatness to achieve accuracy and are used as bases for mounting sophisticated mechanical, electronic and optical gauging systems. Our quality inspectors and engineers put a strict vigilance at all the stages of the production procedure to ensure high quality plates. Further, the final inspection is carried out by a High Precision Computerized Electronic Level made by WYLER OF SWITZERLAND. Our range of Granite surface plates are utilized in Precision tool rooms, Engineering industries and Research laboratories.We provide fabricated stand with leveling screws on request by our clients. The overall working height of surface plates with stand and levelling screw will be 900 MM (approx) from floor level.
